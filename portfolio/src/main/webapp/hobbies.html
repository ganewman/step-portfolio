          these.
    <h3 id="ballroom">Ballroom and Latin Dancing</h3>
    <p>I compete ballroom and latin dancing within the collegiate competitive
        circuit. I am actually on my college team's board, as the Events
        Coordinator, which means I am in charge of all space bookings for
        practices. I have been competing ballroom since I got to college,
        so for about two years.I just moved up to the silver level this 
        spring. In order, the collegiate levels are roughly as 
        follows:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Newcomer</li>
            <li>Bronze</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
            <li>Open</li>
        </ol>
    <p>There are 19 competitive ballroom dances, falling into four different
        categories. I don't compete all of them, but I do compete most of them!
        Here is a table showing the different dances, with links to some
        examples.
    </p>

    <p>There are also many social dances which are not in the
        main competitive circuit. My three favorites are West Coast
        Swing, Bachata, and Salsa.
