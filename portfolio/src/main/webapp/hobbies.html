      Below I will take a closer look and provide some more context for some of
          these.
    <h3 id="ballroom">Ballroom and Latin Dancing</h3>
    <p>I compete ballroom and latin dancing within the collegiate competitive
        circuit. I am actually on my college team's board, as the Events
        Coordinator, which means I am in charge of all space bookings for
        practices. I have been competing ballroom since I got to college,
        so for about two years.I just moved up to the silver level this 
        spring. In order, the collegiate levels are roughly as 
        follows:
    </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Newcomer</li>
            <li>Bronze</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
            <li>Open</li>
        </ol>
    <p>There are 19 competitive ballroom dances, falling into four different
        categories. I don't compete all of them, but I do compete most of them!
        Here is a table showing the different dances, with links to some
        examples of my favorites.

    </table>
    <p>My favorite of these dances is Jive!</p>
    <p>There are also many social dances which are not in the
        main competitive circuit. My three favorites are West Coast
        Swing, Bachata, and Salsa.

    <h3 id="xstitch">Cross Stitch</h3>
    <p>Cross stitch is a type of embroidery consisting of many tiny X's
        as well as the possible addition of specialty stitches such
        as backstitch (which creates outlines) and french knots
        (which create the appearance of florets).
        There are some pictures of my own cross stitches in the gallery,
        but here are some images of patterns I am currently working on,
        which have been completed by other people.
