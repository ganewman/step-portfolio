      <h1>Gabi Newman's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is Gabi's portfolio.</p>
      <p>Gabi is a junior at University of Massachusetts Amherst, where she is
          double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Is it weird
          that this page is written in the third person? Maybe. She's not sure,
          so let's just go with it. Gabi's STEP internship in the summer of
          2020 is her first time interning at Google, and she is very excited
          about all of the new things she hopes to learn! When not doing CS,
          she enjoys ballroom/latin dancing, cross stitching, spending time
          with her friends (virtually, if she has to!). She will be turning
          20 years old in June.
      </p>
      <p>This page is pink because that is Gabi's favorite color.</p>
      <p>Here is a fun selfie she took a while ago!</p>
