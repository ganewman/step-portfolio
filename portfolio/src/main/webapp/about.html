      <h3 id="childhood">Childhood</h3>
      <p>My full name is Gabrielle Newman and I'm 20 years old.
          I grew up in Brooklyn, New York. My family moved around
          the city a bit, but I lived in NYC my whole life until I
          left for college. I went to high school in Manhatten, and
          taking the subway to school every day was a really cool
          experience. Well, except for when train delays would make me
          late for class.
      </p>
      <h3 id="cs">Computer Science</h3>
      <p>I got into computer science when I took a required introductory
          class as a sophomore, and haven't looked back since. I love puzzles
          and problem solving, and for me, that's what CS is all about!
          Within CS, the two areas I've found myself the most interested
          in are theoretical CS and operating systems. They're very
          different, but what can I say? I just love to write proofs and
          code in C.
      </p>
      <h3 id="school">School</h3>
      <p>I currently attend the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where
          I just finished up my sophomore year. I'm a double major in 
          Computer Science and Mathematics (with a concentration in computing).
          I'm also in the Commonwealth Honors College at UMass, part of which
          means I'm on track to write a thesis in my senior year. The thought
          of it is honestly pretty scary, since I know it will be a lot of
          work. However, I also think it'll be a really great learning
          experience.
          UMass can be really fun, since it's so big and in such a beautiful
          area (western Massachusetts). However, it can also be hard to find
          myself so far from home. Still, I've made a lot of great friends
          in my time there and wouldn't trade the experience for anything.
      </p>
      <h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
      <p>I took Japanese as my foreign language in high school, as well as an
          intensive course for a semester in college. My Japanese actually
          isn't half bad! I can write fairly quickly and neatly, though my
          reading is much better than my listening comprehension. I'd really
          love to move to Japan for a few months someday to try and improve
          my fluency. Right now, I'm hardly at the level of an elementary
          schooler.
          However, my first language was actually Hebrew! I unfortunately
          don't speak it very well anymore, but I was totally fluent as a
          child. I also used to be able to read and write fairly well. Now,
          my listening comprehension is OK but that's about all. I wish I
          had time to take a Hebrew language course... I think it would
          come back to me pretty quickly!
      </p>
      <h3 id="pets">Pets</h3>
      <p>My favorite animals in the entire world are cats! I just think
          they're so cute, fluffy, and cuddly. I used to have a cat named
          Scout, who I raised from the time he was a kitten. Unfortunately,
          since I left for college, he hasn't been living with me. Instead
          he's been staying with my cousin. But he's still a very cute and
          happy kitty! There are some pictures of him on the gallery page.
